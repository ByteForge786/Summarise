I'd be happy to provide you with a table and two SQL queries that fetch the same result but are written differently. Let's start with a simple example:

Table: `employees`

| id | first_name | last_name | department | salary |
|----|------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1  | John       | Doe       | Sales      | 50000  |
| 2  | Jane       | Smith     | Marketing  | 60000  |
| 3  | Mike       | Johnson   | IT         | 75000  |
| 4  | Sarah      | Williams  | Sales      | 55000  |
| 5  | David      | Brown     | IT         | 70000  |

Now, let's create two SQL queries that fetch the same result but are written differently:

Query 1:
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

Query 2:
```sql
WITH dept_salaries AS (
  SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department
)
SELECT department, avg_salary
FROM dept_salaries
WHERE avg_salary > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

Both of these queries will return the same result: a list of departments with their average salaries, where the average salary is greater than 60000, sorted in descending order by average salary.

Would you like me to explain how these queries work or provide a breakdown of their differences?
